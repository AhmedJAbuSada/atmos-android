## Why this repository exists

Most sample apps show only the finished code. This one shows **how a professional
project grows**, one level per branch, from documents to a released app, with each step
explained:

| Step | Branch | What you learn |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | [`step-01-planning`](../../tree/step-01-planning) | PRD, user stories, API contract, architecture, ADRs, team process, AI agent rules |
| 02 | [`step-02-project-structure`](../../tree/step-02-project-structure) | Gradle modules that enforce Clean Architecture, DI, linting, CI |
| 03 | `step-03-domain-layer` | Entities, use cases, errors as values, pure unit tests |
| 04 | `step-04-data-layer` | Retrofit, mappers, Room cache, DataStore, cache-first repositories |
| 05 | `step-05-presentation-ui` | Design system, Compose screens, ViewModels, previews (dark, RTL) |
| 06 | `step-06-integration` | Real data, location, search, offline mode, navigation |
| 07 | `step-07-quality-release` | Localization, accessibility, performance, UI tests, release |
| — | `main` | The finished app |

## The same app on four platforms

| Platform | Repository |
|---|---|
| **Android** (Kotlin, Compose) | you are here |
| iOS (Swift, SwiftUI) | [atmos-ios](https://github.com/AhmedJAbuSada/atmos-ios) |
| React Native (TypeScript) | [atmos-react-native](https://github.com/AhmedJAbuSada/atmos-react-native) |
| Flutter (Dart) | [atmos-flutter](https://github.com/AhmedJAbuSada/atmos-flutter) |

Same features, same architecture, same step-by-step plan. Compare how each platform
solves the same problem.

## Features (v1.0)

- 📍 Current weather at your location
- 🕐 Next 24 hours and 🗓 next 7 days
- 🔍 City search with names in your language, ⭐ saved cities
- 📴 Works offline with the last known data
- 🌡 °C / °F, km/h / m/s / mph
- 🌙 Dark mode
- 🌍 **English, Türkçe, العربية** (full right-to-left layout)

Weather data by [Open-Meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/). No API key is needed:
clone and run.

## Architecture at a glance

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    app[":app<br/>Compose UI + ViewModels"] --> domain[":domain<br/>pure Kotlin<br/>entities, use cases"]
    data[":data<br/>Retrofit, Room, DataStore"] --> domain
    app --> data
```

The domain depends on nothing. The compiler enforces it, because each layer is its own
Gradle module. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🤖 Built with an AI agent, the professional way

This project is built by a developer working with **Claude Code**. The repository shows
the whole method, not just the result:

- [**AI_WORKFLOW.md**](docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md): the spec → plan → review → build → verify →
  review loop, what to delegate and what not, and how to verify AI output.
- [**AGENTS.md**](AGENTS.md): the rules file every AI session loads, so it follows the
  architecture.
- [**docs/ai/prompts/**](docs/ai/prompts/): the real prompts used at each step.
- Every step guide ends with **"How the AI agent helped in this step"**, including what
  went wrong.
- Commits written with the agent carry a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` line.

## Run it

Requirements: Android Studio (latest stable), or JDK 21 plus the Android SDK.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedJAbuSada/atmos-android.git
cd atmos-android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Quality checks, the same ones CI runs:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck checkLocaleSafeCasing lint test
```
